If you are anything like me, organizing trips with my friends is nothing short of herding cats. As avid outdoorsman, many of our activities that we embark on during these trips involve a lot of gear that each individual needs. If we are fly-fishing in Idaho, we're looking at a set of flies, two different rods, and waders... the list goes on and on. GearList was created to help alleviate some of these pains, allowing trip organizers to add other users to their organized trips. Within these organized trips, organizers can create mandatory gear lists that "adventurers" on their trips can check off as they acquire them. 

Adventurers can also create personal item lists, to keep track of items that they shouldn't necessarily need someone else to tell them to have... (ie a tooth brush!) to view all of the items they need for their upcoming trip!
